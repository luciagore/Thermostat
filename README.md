Thermostat Challenge - Change the temperature on the Thermostat based on the current weather outside!
=====================

* Project worked on during afternoon pair programming sessions June 13-15 2018 - Week 5
* First full project from scratch in Javascript
* First project using JQuery, API and Callback patterns, as well as HTML & CSS in Javascript

Challenge:
-------

The aim is to write code and test the code, to create a thermostat with a power saving mode - as well as functions to increase and decrease the temperature. The thermostat will have an option to check the outside temperature depending on the city that its in

Features:
-------

Part one: building the basic business logic for the Thermostat and testing the framework:
* Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
* You can increase the temperature with an up function
* You can decrease the temperature with a down function
* The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
* If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
* If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
* Power saving mode is on by default
* You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
* You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, < 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
